<p>♫ <a href="music/The Remembered Friendship of the Harvest Moon.mp3">The Remembered Friendship of the Harvest Moon</a> - by VYCM</p>
<p><b>Comment:</b> An early version of the title screen theme from Dream Logical World, made when the tone and atmosphere of the game were still being worked out. It ended up being too slow and lazy for my liking.</p>

<p>♫ <a href="music/The Story of Aimi in Eastern Wonderland.mp3">The Story of Aimi in Eastern Wonderland</a> - by VYCM</p>
<p><b>Comment:</b> An unused track from Dream Logical World, intended to be the Last Word theme. It's an arrangement of Pure Land Mandala from Story of Eastern Wonderland (and no, it was actually made before I even knew about Return of Eastern Wonderland). I later felt I could make a more fitting original track, and ended up throwing together the final Last Word theme about two weeks before the full release.</p>

<p>♫ <a href="music/Angry Misled Bee ~ Colony Collapse.mp3">Angry Misled Bee ~ Colony Collapse</a> - by VYCM</p>
<p><b>Comment:</b> A theme I made for a Touhou bee character, created by Ramtoi as a hypothetical fangame boss. You can figure out where the title comes from if you're familiar with the literal translation of DoDonPachi.</p>

<br>DLW character sketches - by VYCM

<p><b>Comment:</b> Early sketches of the new enemy characters, plus title screen Reimu, intended for the game's actual artist to use as a base. Katerina probably changed the least, while Kiseki and Aimi definitely changed the most. We also went with a totally different pose for title Reimu; my original idea shown here was to have her staring quizzically at the distorted Gensokyo, but we later decided on something more active and confident-looking.</p>

<p><b>Comment (VYCM):</b> Unlike the other characters, I didn't really have a design in mind for Miyu, so I gave Ramtoi free reign, only specifying that she was an artist with long pink hair.</p>
